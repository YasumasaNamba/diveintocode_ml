On top of these convolutional features, we construct an RPN by adding a few additional convolutional layers that simultaneously regress region bounds adn objectness scores at each location on a regular grid. The RPN is thus a kind of fully convolutional network and can be trained ene_to_end specifically for the task for generating detection proposals."
